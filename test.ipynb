       " 'success': True,\n",
       " 'answer': '1. Executive Summary (≈65 words)\\nAcross all nine trials reviewed, age was the principal demographic variable used for inclusion/exclusion, with each study specifying a lower and/or upper age boundary. All trials were open to “Sex: ALL,” so gender was not a restrictive factor. None of the protocols required a specific racial/ethnic background, although several employed language or residency requirements (e.g., English or Italian fluency, permanent residence) that may indirectly influence participant demographics.\\n\\n2. Detailed Analysis\\n• NCT06368674 – Inclusion: ≥75 yrs; “Sex: ALL.” Must reside in a permanent residence within the Sahlgrenska catchment area. Cognition not exclusionary.  \\n• NCT05411120 – Inclusion: 18-60 yrs; “Sex: ALL.” English fluency and access to digital technology required.  \\n• NCT06951620 – Inclusion: >65 yrs; “Sex: ALL.” No ethnicity stipulation.  \\n• NCT07120074 – Inclusion: 20-50 yrs; “Sex: ALL.” No language criterion.  \\n• NCT06854874 – Inclusion: children 5-13 yrs (caregiver-reported); “Sex: ALL.” Parents must speak Italian.  \\n• NCT06551974 – Inclusion: >18 yrs; “Sex: ALL.” Italian speaking and smartphone access required.  \\n• NCT06307574 – Inclusion: ≥60 yrs; “Sex: ALL.” English fluency; community-dwelling.  \\n• NCT06338774 – Inclusion: 40-65 yrs; “Sex: ALL.” English fluency; full-time employment (≥35 hrs/week).  \\n• NCT06997874 (SWATs embedded in COMBAT) – Demographic focus is observational; no explicit eligibility cut-offs but aims to monitor recruitment/retention across underserved demographic groups.\\n\\n3. Study Characteristics\\n• Designs range from randomized dietary or exercise interventions (NCT05411120, NCT07120074, NCT06338774) to observational or validation studies (NCT06854874, NCT06997874) and geriatric care pathway research (NCT06368674).  \\n• Populations span children (5-13 yrs), young adults, mid-life workers, older adults (60-75 yrs), and the frail elderly (≥75 yrs).  \\n• All trials allow both males and females; none are sex-specific.  \\n• Interventions include diet modification, mobile-app–guided self-help, cardiac rehabilitation optimization, digital medication adherence tools, and dual-task balance training.\\n\\n4. Key Findings and Patterns\\n• Age framing is universal and tightly aligned to study aims (childhood disability, workforce adherence, frailty, etc.).  \\n• Gender equity: all trials explicitly list “Sex: ALL.”  \\n• Race/ethnicity: absent from all inclusion/exclusion language; instead, language proficiency (English or Italian) appears in four studies [NCT05411120, NCT06551974, NCT06307574, NCT06338774].  \\n• Geographic or residency requirements surface in geriatric care (NCT06368674) and Italian-based studies (NCT06854874, NCT06551974).  \\n• No trial reports stratifying or analyzing enrolment targets by ethnicity, though NCT06997874 plans to track recruitment of “underserved groups.”\\n\\n5. Practical Implications\\n• Patients: eligibility hinges primarily on age; language proficiency and technology access can be decisive secondary filters.  \\n• Researchers: explicit age windows aid targeted recruitment but may limit generalizability across life stages; absence of racial/ethnic criteria may necessitate active outreach to ensure diversity.  \\n• Study design: adopting language or digital-access criteria streamlines interventions but risks excluding otherwise eligible participants lacking these resources.\\n\\n6. Data Limitations\\n• None of the protocols list racial or ethnic criteria, making it impossible to assess intended diversity strategies.  \\n• Socio-economic status, educational level, and detailed geographic data are largely unreported.  \\n• Trial phases are not uniformly stated, limiting comparisons of eligibility evolution from early- to late-phase studies.\\n\\nEndpoint Prediction: No endpoint prediction available',\n",

      "1. Executive Summary (≈65 words)\n",
      "Across all nine trials reviewed, age was the principal demographic variable used for inclusion/exclusion, with each study specifying a lower and/or upper age boundary. All trials were open to “Sex: ALL,” so gender was not a restrictive factor. None of the protocols required a specific racial/ethnic background, although several employed language or residency requirements (e.g., English or Italian fluency, permanent residence) that may indirectly influence participant demographics.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Detailed Analysis\n",
      "• NCT06368674 – Inclusion: ≥75 yrs; “Sex: ALL.” Must reside in a permanent residence within the Sahlgrenska catchment area. Cognition not exclusionary.  \n",
      "• NCT05411120 – Inclusion: 18-60 yrs; “Sex: ALL.” English fluency and access to digital technology required.  \n",
      "• NCT06951620 – Inclusion: >65 yrs; “Sex: ALL.” No ethnicity stipulation.  \n",
      "• NCT07120074 – Inclusion: 20-50 yrs; “Sex: ALL.” No language criterion.  \n",
      "• NCT06854874 – Inclusion: children 5-13 yrs (caregiver-reported); “Sex: ALL.” Parents must speak Italian.  \n",
      "• NCT06551974 – Inclusion: >18 yrs; “Sex: ALL.” Italian speaking and smartphone access required.  \n",
      "• NCT06307574 – Inclusion: ≥60 yrs; “Sex: ALL.” English fluency; community-dwelling.  \n",
      "• NCT06338774 – Inclusion: 40-65 yrs; “Sex: ALL.” English fluency; full-time employment (≥35 hrs/week).  \n",
      "• NCT06997874 (SWATs embedded in COMBAT) – Demographic focus is observational; no explicit eligibility cut-offs but aims to monitor recruitment/retention across underserved demographic groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Study Characteristics\n",
      "• Designs range from randomized dietary or exercise interventions (NCT05411120, NCT07120074, NCT06338774) to observational or validation studies (NCT06854874, NCT06997874) and geriatric care pathway research (NCT06368674).  \n",
      "• Populations span children (5-13 yrs), young adults, mid-life workers, older adults (60-75 yrs), and the frail elderly (≥75 yrs).  \n",
      "• All trials allow both males and females; none are sex-specific.  \n",
      "• Interventions include diet modification, mobile-app–guided self-help, cardiac rehabilitation optimization, digital medication adherence tools, and dual-task balance training.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Key Findings and Patterns\n",
      "• Age framing is universal and tightly aligned to study aims (childhood disability, workforce adherence, frailty, etc.).  \n",
      "• Gender equity: all trials explicitly list “Sex: ALL.”  \n",
      "• Race/ethnicity: absent from all inclusion/exclusion language; instead, language proficiency (English or Italian) appears in four studies [NCT05411120, NCT06551974, NCT06307574, NCT06338774].  \n",
      "• Geographic or residency requirements surface in geriatric care (NCT06368674) and Italian-based studies (NCT06854874, NCT06551974).  \n",
      "• No trial reports stratifying or analyzing enrolment targets by ethnicity, though NCT06997874 plans to track recruitment of “underserved groups.”\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Practical Implications\n",
      "• Patients: eligibility hinges primarily on age; language proficiency and technology access can be decisive secondary filters.  \n",
      "• Researchers: explicit age windows aid targeted recruitment but may limit generalizability across life stages; absence of racial/ethnic criteria may necessitate active outreach to ensure diversity.  \n",
      "• Study design: adopting language or digital-access criteria streamlines interventions but risks excluding otherwise eligible participants lacking these resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Data Limitations\n",
      "• None of the protocols list racial or ethnic criteria, making it impossible to assess intended diversity strategies.  \n",
      "• Socio-economic status, educational level, and detailed geographic data are largely unreported.  \n",
      "• Trial phases are not uniformly stated, limiting comparisons of eligibility evolution from early- to late-phase studies.\n",
